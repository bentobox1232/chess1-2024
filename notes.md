how to call in terminal
    : java -cp bin/ X arg1 arg2 ...



store the chess game on a 2D Array
other data structures will be more troublesome

inheritance of the piece classes will be used for a specific piece but its not ideal to do it

do the chess class does not have subclasses, make of 6 move calculators

the chess piece class with the given variables, calling the calculator, as a state/strategy pattern

Collection:
    arrayList, is ideal for that. so then implementation any return
    try to return the least specific as you can, but still have the functionality
